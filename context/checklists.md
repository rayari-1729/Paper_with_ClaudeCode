# Quality & Safety Checklists

## Before Coding
- [ ] Identified core algorithm(s)
- [ ] Identified key innovation
- [ ] Identified baseline

## During Coding
- [ ] Algorithms written as pure functions
- [ ] Dependencies injected
- [ ] Verbose mode implemented
- [ ] Intermediate states printed

## Before Delivery
- [ ] Notebook runs top-to-bottom
- [ ] Results align qualitatively with paper
- [ ] Plots are interpretable
- [ ] No GPU required
- [ ] Summary explains intuition

## Red Flags
- Silent functions
- No plots
- “Trust me” logic
- Over-engineering
- Production abstractions
